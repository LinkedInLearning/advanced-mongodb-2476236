Expand on what you learned in MongoDB Essential Training by exploring advanced features and concepts within this powerful document database. Instructor Naomi Pentrel divides the course into four standalone sections. To begin, Naomi covers advanced features, such as change streams and GridFS. She then dives into advanced collection types and indexes that can help you use MongoDB more efficiently; how to scale your deployment using sharding; and how to use client-side field-level encryption to encrypt sensitive data before it even leaves the client. After wrapping up this course, youâ€™ll have the information you need to start getting more value from your database.

## Instructions
